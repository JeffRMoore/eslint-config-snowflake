This is my coding standard. There are many like it, but this one is mine.

My coding standard is my best friend. It is my life. I must master it as I must master my life.

Without me, my coding standard is useless. Without my coding standard, I am useless. I must check in against my coding standard true. I must be more consistent than my enemy who is trying to confuse me. I must clarify before he confuses me. I will...

My coding standard and I know that what counts in development is not the amount of code we type, the noise of our keyboard, nor the commits we make. We know that it is the understanding that counts. We will be understandable...

My coding standard is human, even as I, because it is my life. Thus, I will learn it as a brother. I will learn its weaknesses, its strength, its parts, its accessories, its sights and its barrel. I will keep my coding standard clean and ready, even as I am clean and ready. We will become part of each other. We will...

Before Github, I swear this creed. My coding standard and I are the defenders of my code. We are the masters of chaos. We are the saviors of my life.

So be it, until the code is retired and there are no more commits, but peace!
